* Migratus
  MIGRATE ALL THE THINGS!!

  A general migration framework, with an implementation for database migrations.

  Designed to be compatible with a git based work flow where multiple topic
  branches may exist simultaneously, and be merged into a master branch in
  unpredictable order.

  This is accomplished two ways:
  1. Migration versions are timestamps (e.g. '20111202091200').
  2. Migrations are considered for completion independently.

  Using a single global version for a store and incremented numbers for
  migration versions it is possible for a higher numbered migration to get
  merged to master and deployed before a lower numbered migration, in which case
  the lower numbered migration would never get run, unless it is renumbered.

  Migratus considers each migration independently, and runs all uncompleted
  migrations in order.
** Usage
   Migratus can be used programmatically by calling one of the following
   methods:

   | Method                | Description                                                                                       |
   |-----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | migratus.core/migrate | Run any migrations that have not been run.                                                        |
   | migratus.core/up      | Run 'up' for the specified migration versions. Will skip a version whose 'up' has already run.    |
   | migratus.core/down    | Run 'down' for the specified migration versions. Will skip a version whose 'up' has not been run. |
